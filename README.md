## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and 
implementation of a store layout optimization recommendation 
system that integrates market basket analysis with graph representation learning and evolutionary optimization. The system aims to enhance offline retail efficiency by minimizing customer walking distance and maximizing cross-selling opportunities. Transaction data is first preprocessed and modeled into a co-occurrence graph. Association rules are extracted using both Apriori and GraphSAGE algorithms to capture explicit and implicit product relationships. A genetic algorithm then optimizes the product-to-shelf mapping on a grid-based store layout, balancing path cost and association proximity through a normalized objective function. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over heuristic and random layouts in simulation experiments. A web-based front-end interface, built with Tailwind CSS and Chart.js, enables real-time visualization, configuration, and interactive analysis. This system demonstrates a practical and scalable solution for data-driven retail space optimization, providing both operational and commercial value for physical retailers in the era of digital transformation.
